Yet all the people are supposed to be Christians, have been baptized, and receive the Holy Sacrament even though they do not know the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, or the Ten Commandments and live like poor animals of the barnyard and pigpen. What these people have mastered, however, is the fine art of tearing all Christian liberty to shreds.",

Stress especially that commandment or any other specific part of the catechism doctrine which your people neglect most. For example, among craftsmen and merchants, farmers and employees, you must powerfully stress the Seventh Commandment, which forbids stealing, because among such people many kinds of dishonesty and thievery occur. Also, for young persons and the common man you must stress the Fourth Commandment, urging them to be orderly, faithful, obedient, and peaceable, always bringing in many Bible examples of how God punished or blessed such people.",

Thoroughly underscore what terrible harm they do by not helping train children to become pastors, preachers, writers, and the like, and how God will punish them for it.

Here again urging is necessary, however, with the understanding that we are not to force anyone into the faith or to the Sacrament, nor set any law, time, or place for it. Our preaching should instead be such that of their own accord and without our command, people feel constrained themselves and press us pastors to serve the Sacrament. The way to go about this is to tell them that if anyone does not seek or desire the Lord’s Supper at the very least four times a year, it is to be feared that he despises the Sacrament and is not Christian, just as no one is a Christian who does not believe or hear the Gospel. For Christ did not say, \"Omit this\" or \"despise this,\" but \"This do, as often as you drink it,\" etc. He most certainly wants it done and does not want it left undone and despised. \"This do,\" He says.",

On the other hand, he needs no grace, life, paradise, kingdom of heaven, Christ, God, or any good thing. Surely, if he recognized how much evil is in him and how much he needs all the good things he lacks, he would not neglect the Sacrament, which gives help against such evil and bestows so much goodness.

TRANSLATION WORKFLOWS
---------------------

WORKFLOW 1: ONLINE TRANSLATION (Recommended)

Step 1: Select a File
- Click any file in the left sidebar
- File opens in text translation area

Step 2: Enter Translated File Title
- At top of translation area, enter the translated version of the file title
- Example: "The Lord's Prayer" becomes "Isä meidän rukous"
- This becomes the download filename: isä-meidän-rukous.md

Step 3: Translate Each Section
- Original English text appears in gray box above the translation area
- Type your translation in the white text box below
- As you type, the box turns green to indicate progress
- Progress autosaves–no save button needed!

Step 4: Mark Sections as N/A (if needed)
- Some sections may not apply to your language or culture
- Check "Mark as Not Applicable" for these sections
- N/A sections count as "complete" for progress
- N/A sections are excluded from the downloaded file

Step 5: Download
- When file reaches 100%, download button becomes active (blue)
- Click "Download" to save as .md file
- Filename uses your translated title
- Download includes proper markdown formatting

Step 6: Submit
- Email completed .md files to jeremy.roegner@cph.org


WORKFLOW 2: OFFLINE TRANSLATION

When to Use:
- Unreliable internet connection
- Prefer working in your favorite text editor
- Want to print translations for review
- Need to work without the web interface

Step 1: Download Offline Files
- Click blue "Download Offline Files (.zip)" button (blue, top section)
- Downloads all 13 files as .txt files in a single zip
- Extract the zip file to your computer

Step 2: Open Files in your Text Editor of choice
Each .txt file contains:
- File title and category
- Offline translation instructions
- Numbered sections with original English text
- Space for your translations
- Reminder to email completed work

Step 3: Translate
- Write your translation in the "YOUR TRANSLATION:" section

Step 4: Submit
- Option A: Copy translations back into web tool, then download as .md
  - Open the Small Catechism Translation tool in your browser
  - Select the file from the sidebar
  - Paste each translation into the corresponding section in the tool
  - The tool will automatically apply proper formatting
  - Download the final .md file when complete
- Option B: Email completed .txt files directly to jeremy.roegner@cph.org

================================================================

FEATURES IN DETAIL
------------------

AUTOSAVE

How it works:
- Translations save automatically as you type
- File titles save automatically when you enter them
- Progress saves to your browser's local storage
- No manual save button needed

When autosave happens:
- Every time you finish typing in a text box
- When you check/uncheck "Mark as Not Applicable"
- When you enter a translated file title

Important notes:
- Autosave is per browser, per device
- Clearing browser data will erase saved progress
- Use "Download All Completed Files" as backup


PROGRESS TRACKING

Overall Progress:
- Shows at top of sidebar
- Percentage of all files completed
- Green progress bar visualizes completion

Individual File Progress:
- Shows next to each file name in sidebar
- Percentage of sections translated in that file
- 100% = all sections translated or marked N/A

Visual Indicators:
- Green boxes = translated sections
- Gray boxes = pending sections
- Green sidebar items = completed files
- Blue badge = Header section (displays larger and bold)
- Purple badge = Question section (displays in italics)
- Gray badge = Regular text section

NOT APPLICABLE (N/A) FEATURE

Purpose:
Some catechism sections may not apply to your language or cultural context.

How to use:
1. Check "Mark as Not Applicable" below any section
2. Section counts as "complete" for progress tracking
3. Section is excluded from the downloaded .md file
4. Translation text box becomes disabled (grayed out)

Example use cases:
- Cultural references that don't translate
- Sections redundant in your language
- Content not relevant to your translation scope

Note: N/A sections won't appear in the download file.


DOWNLOAD OPTIONS

Individual File Download:
- Button appears at top of each file's translation area
- Button becomes active (blue) when file is 100% complete
- Downloads single .md file with markdown formatting
- Filename uses your translated file title
- Example: isä-meidän-rukous.md

Download All Completed Files:
- Button in "Translation Progress" section at top
- Button becomes active (green) when all files are 100% complete
- Downloads all completed files automatically
- Files download one after another with slight delay
- Creates complete translation package

Download Offline Files:
- Button in "Offline Translation" section at top
- Button is always active and downloads immediately
- Creates .zip file containing all 13 .txt files
- Files include instructions for offline translation
- Filename: catechism-translation-files.zip


MARKDOWN FORMATTING

What is Markdown?
Markdown is simple text formatting that the catechism app uses to display 
headers, italics, and structure.

Formatting preserved:
- ### Header text - Main section headers
- #### Header text - Subsection headers  
- _Question text_ - Italicized questions

How it works:
- Original English text has Markdown symbols
- Display shows clean text (symbols hidden from translator)
- Download applies same formatting to your translation
- No need to add formatting yourself!

Example:
- English original: ### The First Commandment
- You translate: Ensimmäinen käsky
- Downloaded file: ### Ensimmäinen käsky

The tool automatically applies the ### to your translation.

================================================================

FILE STRUCTURE
--------------

================================================================

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
----------------

Avoid Common Issues

Don't translate Markdown symbols:
- The tool handles all formatting automatically
- Just translate the text content
- Symbols like ### and _ are added for you

Don't worry about losing work:
- Autosave protects your progress
- Browser stores everything locally
- "Download All" provides backup

Don't skip the file title:
- Translated title becomes filename
- Helps organize multiple languages
- Makes files easy to identify

================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Issue: Progress Not Saving
Solution:
- Check that browser allows local storage
- Don't use Private/Incognito mode
- Ensure browser data isn't set to clear on exit

Issue: Download Button Not Active
Check:
- Are progress percentages in sidebar at 100% completion?
- Are all sections translated or marked N/A?
- Look at progress percentage in sidebar

Issue: Special Characters Look Wrong
Solution:
- This is normal in the tool—they'll be correct in downloaded files
- HTML entities display differently
- Download and open .md file to verify

Issue: Can't Find Downloaded Files
Check:
- Browser's default download folder
- Look for filename matching your translated title
- Check for .md extension (Markdown files)

Issue: Cleared Progress Accidentally
Recovery:
- If you have downloaded .md (Markdown) files, use those
- No way to recover from local storage after clearing
- This is why "Download All" provides good backup

================================================================
